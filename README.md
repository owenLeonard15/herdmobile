# Herd Mobile

# Project Summary
Herd is a restaurant recommendation app that relies on a social network of users to make its recommendations. Most competitor applications rely on user ratings of restaurants which results in users receiving similar suggestions from a similar pool of well-rated restaurants. In this way, they fail to provide a personalized experience to each user. Instead of following this typical ratings based recommendation system, Herd recommends restaurants according to each user’s social network and the restaurants that each user’s friends have enjoyed. This creates a much more unique and valuable experience for the user.
